While the point_count data include the observation_time variable, this information for the acoustic_data seems to be at the begin_clock_time variable.

We can incorporate these covariates in a hierarchical model. These figures also allow to estimate the variance-to-mean ratio (VMR) of our two data sources (counts and acoustic detections) to select a family distribution accordingly. Recall a simple, clear table of VMR values: VMR_table &lt;- data.frame( Distribution = c(&quot;Constant random variable&quot;, &quot;Binomial&quot;,&quot;Poisson&quot;, &quot;Negative binomial&quot;), VMR = c(&quot;VMR = 0&quot;, &quot;0&lt;VMR&lt;1&quot;, &quot;VMR = 1&quot;, &quot;VMR&gt;1&quot;) ) knitr::kable(VMR_table) So, estimating these VMR per species: acoust_count_summary |&gt; group_by(common_name) |&gt; summarise(meanCounts = mean(counts), varCounts = var(counts), VMR_counts = varCounts/meanCounts, meanAcouDet = mean(acous_detections), varAcouDet = var(acous_detections), VMR_AcouDet = varAcouDet/meanAcouDet) |&gt; #summary() as.data.frame() # to see all the table We can see that VMR_counts is between 0 and 1, while VMR_AcousticDetection &gt; 1. These ranges suggest using a Binomial and a Negative binomial distributions, respectively, in the observation process. 7.3 Hierarchical model for counts with two observation processes 7.3.1 State process for each morning Assuming that every morning of sampling we find a latent number of individuals in each site (including several point counts?) that fluctuates around a mean stationary number, we can see some similarities with a Stochastic Gompertz State Space population dynamics model, which in continuous time follows a Gaussian (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, OU) diffusion dynamic. Let’s model the latent process of log-counts \\(X_{i,t} = \\ln(C_{i,t})\\) for species \\(i\\) in time \\(t\\) (sampling point count) in a site \\(m\\). We can simplify this (for now) by only working in a site (\\(m = 1\\); Katahdin Woods and Waters) and four species example (\\(i = 1,2,3,4\\); Ovenbird - OVEN, Pine Warbler - PAWA, Red-eyed Vireo - REVI, Scarlet Tanager - SCTA). On the logarithmic scale, the process becomes linear and follows an autoregressive model of order 1 (note we are not including the index \\(m\\) for now): \\[ X_{i,t+1} = a_i + c_i * X_{i,t} + \\epsilon_{i,t}; ~ \\epsilon \\sim \\text{Normal}(0,\\sigma_i^2) \\] where \\(a_i\\) control the drift (equivalent to the growth rate) of each species, \\(c_i\\) controls the mean-reverting dynamic (such as the strength of density dependence, \\(c = 1 + b\\)), and \\(\\epsilon_{i,t}\\) captures stochasticity in the process, distributed as a normal random variable with some noise of the process \\(\\sigma_i^2\\). In the long-run, we can estimate the mean of the log-counts as a function of the control drift and mean-reverting dynamic: \\[ \\text{E}[X_{\\infty,i}] = \\frac{a_i}{1-c_i} \\] Also the variance of the log-counts is given by the ratio of variance in stochasticity and the square of the mean-reverting dynamic: \\[ \\text{Var}[X_{\\infty,i}] = \\frac{\\sigma_i^2}{1-c_i^2} \\] However, how to deal with Jansen’s inequality?! \\[ e^{(\\text{E}[X_\\infty])} \\leq \\text{E}[e^{(X_\\infty)}] \\] We can estimate the long-run mean count value on the original scale by adding half of the variance, which is our expected counts per species \\(i\\): \\[ \\text{E}[C_{\\infty, i}] = e^{(\\text{E}[X_{\\infty, i}] + (0.5 \\times \\text{Var}[X_{\\infty, i}]))} \\] 7.3.2 Observation process for each morning from point counts The VMR_counts revealed underdispersion, so we can us a Binomial distribution for this observation process: \\[ y_{i,t}^{counts} | C_{i,t} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(\\exp(X_{i,t}),~p_i) \\] where \\(y_{i,t}^{counts}\\) is the observed counts from point counts sampling, \\(\\exp(X_{i,t}) = e^{X_{i,t}}\\) came from the state process and \\(p_{i}\\) is the detection probability per species. 7.3.3 Observation process for each morning from acoustic detections The VMR_AcousticDetection revealed overdispersion, so we can use a Negative Binomial distribution for this observation process: \\[ y_{i,t}^{acoust} \\sim \\text{Negative Binomial}(\\mu_{i,t}, k_i) \\] where \\(y_{i,t}^{acoust}\\) is the observed acoustic detections from sampling point (that overlap with point counts), \\(\\mu_{i,t}\\) is the expected number of acoustic detections per species per time (sampling) and \\(k_i\\) is the overdispersion parameter per species. Then, we can link the expected number of acoustic detections per species (\\(\\mu_{i,t}\\)) with the state process under a log-linear model: \\[ \\log(\\mu_{i,t}) = \\alpha_i + \\gamma_{i} X_{i,t} \\] where \\(\\alpha_i\\) is a species-level intercept and \\(\\gamma_{i}\\) is the scaling parameter with the latent log-abundance \\(X_{i,t}\\). 7.3.4 Coding Create index values.
